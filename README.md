### Introduction
This article attempts to illustrate split-apply-combine strategy in which we break up a big problem into small manageable pieces (Split),
operate on each piece independently (Apply) and then put all the pieces back together (Combine).
Split-Apply-Combine can be used by many existing tools by using GroupBy function in SQL and Python, LOD in Tableau, 
and by using plyr functions in R to name a few. In this article, we will not be discussing only the implementation of this strategy, 
but also we will see some relevant application of this strategy in Feature Engineering.
In Python we do this by using GroupBy and it involves one or more of the three steps of the Split-Apply-Combine strategy.
